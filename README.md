# Diabetes-Prediction

This project presents a comparison of classification algorithms for early stage diabetes prediction. 
Dataset: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Early+stage+diabetes+risk+prediction+dataset.
Seven classification algorithms have been implemented on the validation sat of the used dataset. The results drawn from training several machine learning models clearly indicate that Random Forest Classifier proved to be the best model among the models used in the paper for the concerned dataset with an accuracy score of 98.0778%, ROC score of 0.9979 and F-score of 0.9790. Top three classifiers for the dataset are Random Forests classifier, Multi-layer perceptron and Support Vector Machine. 

An app based on this project is developed that predicts diabetes of a person. The name of the app is DiaBetify. The app is available in Google Play Store.
